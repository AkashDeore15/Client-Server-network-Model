# Client-Server Network Model

A Java-based simulation of a client-server network model.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple client-server architecture using Java. It includes a server that performs mathematical operations and a client that requests these operations.

## Features

- **Server**: Listens for client requests and performs mathematical operations.
- **Client**: Connects to the server to request mathematical computations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkashDeore15/Client-Server-network-Model.git
   cd Client-Server-network-Model
   ```

2. **Compile the Source Code**:
   ```bash
   javac MathServer.java MathClient.java
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   java MathServer
   ```

4. **Run the Client**:
   ```bash
   java MathClient
   ```

## Usage

- **MathServer**: Starts and waits for client connections to perform mathematical operations.
- **MathClient**: Connects to the server and requests specific mathematical computations.
